# Project 1 Real Time Image Filtering

Assingment 1 of PRCV,

Operating System :- Windows

IDE :- Microsoft visual studio  


Steps for excuting :-

1: Compile the files in Visual studio

2: the main function is present in vidDIsplay.cpp 

3: For executing the imgDisplay.cpp just change the 'maint' function in this file to 'main'

4: this is just because a project cannot contain 2 main funcitons,  If this is executed by the terminal this issue won't be there.
